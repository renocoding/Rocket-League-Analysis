# Rocket-League-Analysis
This program goes on the Rocket League player database to find the top 100 Rocket League 3v3 player's username. It then uses those usernames to connect to each player's personal statistic's page. The program then correlates their goals-to-save-to-assist ratio to their MVP-to-GamesPlayed ratio in order to determine if there exists a correlation between playstyle and MVP-to-GamesPlayed ratio.
